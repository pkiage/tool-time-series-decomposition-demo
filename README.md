## Hugging Face Tips

Initial Setup
- [When creating the Spaces Configuration Reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-config-reference) ensure the [Streamlit Space](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-streamlit) version (sdk_version) specified is supported by HF

```shell
git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/pkiage/time_series_autocorrelation_demo

git push --force space main
```
- [When syncing with Hugging Face via Github Actions](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-github-actions) the [User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) created on Hugging Face (HF) should have write access
